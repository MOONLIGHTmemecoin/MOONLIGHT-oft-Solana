# ðŸŒ• MOONLIGHT ($MOONLIGHT) â€” The First Omnichain Memecoin on Solana

## Overview

Moonlight is a viral memecoin built on Solana that is evolving into an **Omnichain community token** using **LayerZero V2**. The goal is to enable seamless cross-chain transferability and community engagement across ecosystems.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of Submission

This project proposes to convert $MOONLIGHT into a LayerZero OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token) using LayerZero V2 on Solana.

We aim to:
- Make $MOONLIGHT omnichain with LayerZero V2
- Allow holders to bridge between Solana and other chains
- Grow the memecoin meta into an interoperable ecosystem
- Introduce cult-style AI-based communities called "Hitchhikers"

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Plan

Due to technical constraints, the current code implementation is incomplete, but here is the intended roadmap:

### Phase 1: Create OFT Contract on Solana
- Write a Rust program using LayerZero V2 OFT template
- Deploy via Anchor framework

### Phase 2: Deploy Companion Contracts
- Deploy destination chain bridges (EVM chains)
- Test bridging and token transfers using LayerZero endpoint APIs

### Phase 3: Frontend + Community Launch
- Web3 UI for bridge
- Community quests and airdrops to reward cross-chain users
